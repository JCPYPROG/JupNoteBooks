    "## Saving\n",
    "\n",
    "Saving your Notebook can be a bit hands-off. You don't get a whole lot of say where the file ends up.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you click the little floppy disk icon in the toolbar (the button to the left of the + for you 00's generation), it will save the current state. Because you've opened this file, it'll save to the original location, no bother; however, if you've made your own Notebook, it's worth realising that the second you make it, it is saved to the root location you had open in the file browser when you clicked new. It won't behave the same as something like Word or Excel, where it hangs around \"unsaved\" until you save it for the first time and choose a location.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### If you're on a cluster PC\n",
    "\n",
    "An added twist on this if you're working on Jupyter on a Uni cluster PC is that the root location when you first opened Jupyter is actually unmodifiable, so (feel free to try it) when you make a new Notebook, it just comes back with a \"File Not Found\" error. You'll need to navigate to a folder you *do* have access to (i.e. Downloads, where we saved this Notebook). **WARNING**: All of the folders you can access via Jupyter are **local**, meaning the second you log off, there is a very high chance the file will be deleted. If you want to keep your work, you *need* to move the Notebook file from wherever you save it to your **M:** drive (the drive with your username as a name). This is your shared space and will remain untouched by any cleaning policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Closing Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your stuff is saved and safely tucked away on your shared space, you need to close Jupyter. You might have noticed a second window when you first opened Jupyter. This is the command console that is hosting your Python Kernel. To *properly* close Jupyter, rather than leaving the process running in the background, simply click in the command console and press **Ctrl+C** a few times. This halts the process and shuts down the local server.\n"
